This repository hosts a Java implementation of the SET card game, a challenging and interactive puzzle game where players score points by identifying valid sets of cards.
The project supports two-player mode, where card selections are made using keyboard shortcuts, as well as a single-player mode (or even only computers players) against a computer opponent that randomly chooses cards from those available on the table.
The game tracks and displays player scores, and imposes temporary penalties for selecting invalid sets.
One of the key objectives of this implementation is to manage concurrent threads effectively, allowing multiple players to engage in the game simultaneously.
This feature leverages Java's capabilities for parallel execution to enhance gameplay and user interaction.
